This repository contains all the code to run the examples for the Poisson process 14C summarisation paper:

Heaton TJ, Bard E & Al-assam S. (to appear) "A New Approach to Radiocarbon Summarisation: Rigorous Identification of Variations/Changepoints in the Occurrence Rate of Radiocarbon Samples using a Poisson Process." Journal of Archaelogical Science (XXXX)

The paper provides a series of analyses, the code to reproduce them (and to generate figures used in manuscripts) can be found here. The scripts can be found in the R/ folder

The specific anlalyses one might wish to run are: 

1) Analysis of 


I recommend substantially updating the README file to include: (1) a citation to the manuscript, and (2) a note that it accompanies a manuscript with the title and authors of the manuscript; (3) a brief description of the files included in the repository and their precise relationship to the figures and tables in the manuscript; (4) the names and version numbers of the key pieces of software used; (5) brief instructions to the user about how to get started working with the project, eg. which file to open first to reproduce the results presented in the paper.
